	<h1>Installing Node and Sublime</h1>
	<h3>Sublime</h3>
	<p>Sublime is a simple, easy-to-use text editor used by many to write code. Most major languages have syntax highlighting in Sublime, meaning different parts of code in a variety of languages are highlighted in different colors, making code significantly easier to read.</p>
	<p>You can download Sublime <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>here</a>. Just select the version of 2.0.2 for your operating system and go through the installation.</p>
